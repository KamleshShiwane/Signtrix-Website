Think about it - when you go to a restaurant and have to order a meal, what would you look at first? An animated TV Menu with specials of the day or a boring piece of paper?

</p>
<p>
Our SignTriX TVs are strategically placed in dining and waiting rooms to ensure it is seen by everyone. We've secured some of the busiest restaurants and waiting rooms across the country.</p>
